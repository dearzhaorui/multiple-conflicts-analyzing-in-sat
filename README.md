Modified CaDiCaL SAT Solver For Evaluation of Multiple Conflicts Analyzing
===============================================================================

This repository is an modified version for an experiment evaluation of multiple conflicts analyzing, originally from the version 1.5.2 of GitHub repository CaDiCaL SAT Solver at <https://github.com/arminbiere/cadical.git>.

The goal of this version is to experimentally evaluate how many different conflicting clauses occur, the contribution based on lemmas' quanlity(e.g. LBD) to the solving process for each of them and exploring the best solving strategy.
